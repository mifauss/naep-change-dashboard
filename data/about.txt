This dashboard visualizes the relationship between pre-COVID NAEP scores (2019) and score changes since the pandemic (2024 scores minus 2019 scores) for states and jurisdictions (e.g., Puerto Rico).

Each line represents a state, connecting the score change at several percentile points (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th) along the student score distribution. These lines illustrate how changes varied across the achievement distribution within each state. A horizontal line at zero helps distinguish cases with score increases (above the zero line) from those with score decreases (below the zero line).

An asterisk next to the stateâ€™s name in the legend indicates a significantly (p < 0.05) larger decrease in scores for lower-performing students (10th percentile) than higher-performing students (90th percentile).
