Use the menu on the left to choose the subject, grade, and whether you'd like to compare all states or only selected ones.
 
You can interact with the plot one of two ways:
 
Using the **legend**: 
* **Single-click** a state in the legend to toggle its line on or off. 
* **Double-click** a legend entry to isolate that state’s line; double-click again to restore all the lines.
 
Using the **selection menu**:
* Select states from the drop-down menu to view their lines only. Click the “x” next to a state name to de-select it.
 
Note that selecting states in the menu on the left is different from clicking their entries in the legend. Think of the selection menu as defining the *data*, and the legend clicks as toggling *visibility*.
